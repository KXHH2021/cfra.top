> > Welcome to kxhh's blog! Here, let's explore uncharted territory together, including cryptocurrencies, technology, science, culture, products, big events, artificial intelligence, travel, food, and more. My goal is to provide readers with interesting, useful, and inspiring content, self-growth, and opening new horizons together.

## About page

The content of the about page is in the `source/about/index.md` file, which you need to modify.

## Add new article

> Once saved here, it will be posted to the website, so it is recommended to upload it after mdnice has written it.

1. Create a new `markdown` file in the `source/_posts` directory with a name in the format of `title.md`, e.g. `hello-world.md` or `hello-world.md`. 2.
2. Add the following to the header of the `markdown` file:

```md
---
title: 标题
date: 发布时间（格式：2023-07-17 20:00:00）
categories:
  - 类别
tags:
  - 标签1
  - 标签2
description: 描述
cover: 封面图片（可选，没有请删掉这一行）
---
```

## Add a new link

In the `source/_data/link.yml` file, follow the format to add a new link.

## Site information modification

If you are not satisfied with the site information generated by default, you can change it in the `config.yml` file:

```yml
title: kxhh's blog
subtitle: Explore uncharted territories and open new horizons
description: Welcome to kxhh's blog! Here, let's explore uncharted territory together, including cryptocurrencies, technology, science, culture, products, big events, artificial intelligence, travel, food, and more. My goal is to provide readers with interesting, useful, and inspiring content, self-growth, and opening new horizons together.
